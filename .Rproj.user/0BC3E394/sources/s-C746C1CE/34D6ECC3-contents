I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I received my MRes in 2020. Before joining LSE, I received my BSc and MSc from the Sharif University of Technology.  My research interests lie in the field of applied econometrics. I am interested in using empirical methods to answer questions across a broad range of topics.  Currently, I am studying the political economy effects of immigration.
