<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">
    I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the London School of Economics and a Research Officer at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. My research interests lie in applied microeconomics. I employ a variety of methods to collect and analyze data, including web scraping, big data analytics, natural language processing, and image processing, to investigate diverse economic questions. I am currently investigating the impact of digital technology on the entrepreneurial landscape in the food industry.

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">
    My academic journey has led me through various institutions, including IFS (Research Officer), Princeton (visiting PhD student), LSE (MRes), and Sharif University (MSc and BSc).

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">
    I will be on the academic job market in the 2024/25 cycle.
