<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">
   I am an Associate at <span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://www.cornerstone.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Cornerstone Research</a></span>, and when I put on my academic hat, I serve as an Associate at the <span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://cep.lse.ac.uk/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Centre for Economic Performance (CEP)</a>, LSE</span>.

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">
   I received my PhD in Economics from the <span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-weight: bold;">London School of Economics</span> in 2025, during which I had the opportunity to visit <span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-weight: bold;">Princeton University</span>, and later the <span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-weight: bold;">Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley</span>. Previously, I also worked as a Research Officer at the <span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://ifs.org.uk" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a></span>.\

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">\
My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, with a focus on labor markets and digital economics. To explore these questions, I combine causal inference methods with tools from big data analytics, machine learning, large language models, natural language processing, image analysis, and web scraping.
